# GWChemPlots
GWChemPlot is a Python module to make groundwater hydrochemical graphs (Schoeller, Piper, and Stiff); GWChemPlot stands for Groundwater chemical plots.

The functions that build the graphs have been adapted with slight modifications from the WQChartPy package https://github.com/jyangfsu/WQChartPy.

Other functions are added to calculate the charge balance error of the hydrochemical analyses and a descriptive classification of dominant ions.
