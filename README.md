# GWChemPlot
Groundwater chemical graphs

This project is a fork of WQChartPy, https://github.com/jyangfsu/WQChartPy.

The graphs included are: Schoeller, Stiff, Piper

There are 2 methods to create the Piper diagram: Piper and Piper2. If the water analysis contains $NO_3^{-}$, the Piper2 method represents it added together with $Cl{-}$.

Two tables can be saved to files:

1. Charge balance of the hydrochemical analyses.

2. Classification of the analyses according to the most abundant ions.
